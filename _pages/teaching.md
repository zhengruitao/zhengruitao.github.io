<p align="center"><img src="https://zhengruitao.github.io/images/Framework of data-driven model.jpg?raw=true" alt="Photo" style="width: 800px;"/></p>
   -Developed a novel method based on [Long Short-Term Memory network](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/typical_LSTM.jpg) and [hidden Markov model](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/GMM-HMM.jpg) (LSTM-HMM) hybrid framework to track the flank wear and predict the remaining useful life of cutting tool during high-speed milling Ti-6Al-4V.

   -The cyber-physical system (CPS) is utilized to collect the internal controller signals and the external sensor signals during machining process. An integrated model that incorporates [convolutional neural network](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/CNN_structure.jpg) with stacked [bidirectional](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/Stacked-Bidirectional-and-Unidirectional-LSTM-Networks.jpg) and unidirectional LSTM (SBULSTM) network(CNN-SBULSTM) is proposed to track the tool wear evolution and predict its RUL.

  -Obtained the cutter-workpiece engagement area using geometric simulation and established the milling force model.<br>
  -The analytical regenerative chatter prediction model was presented and the time/frequency domain solutions were utilized to obtain [Stability Lobe Diagrams(SLD)](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/SLD.jpg).<br>
  -With constant cutting force machining as the optimization target, considering the machining stability, cutting force, torque and machine power constraints, a single-objective optimization model is established, the feedrate is optimized by segments, and the smoothness of the machining process and the machining efficiency are improved.

* ***<font color="#660000">Analysis and Experimental Study on Contact Characteristics of Aviation Sealing Profile</font>*** <br>
  -Study on the macroscopic contact characteristics of sealing profiles by establishing a [finite element model](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/compress_in_depth.jpg) of a typical profiled section seal profile.

## Selected Project
