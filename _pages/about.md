* Hi! I am a Master student at the Manufacturing Technology Lab of the [School of Mechanical Engineering](http://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research intersts mainly lie in the areas of adaptive control, chatter vibration detection/suppression, tool condition monitoring, simulation and optimization of CNC milling process. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. An Qinglong.

* Prior to starting my M.A., I received my B.A. in Mechanical Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology, WEIHAI](http://en.hitwh.edu.cn/) in 2017, ranked top 2 of 137 students in the undergraduate stage [Click to View My Ranking Certification [PDF]](http://zhengruitao.github.io/files/ranking_TZR.pdf) and maintained ranking topmost with a GPA 93.13 for four semsters!
* <font color="#dd0000">I am looking for possible PhD opportunity starting from next year :)  !!!</font>
* Iâ€™m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science with fields like maufacturing technology, composite material structure. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in Computer-Aided Simulation Work, Programing Implementation for fast prototyping and testing, and Verification through Machining Experiments.
