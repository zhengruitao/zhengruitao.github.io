* Hi! I am a Master student at the Manufacturing Technology Lab of the [School of Mechanical Engineering](http://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research intersts mainly lie in the areas of adaptive control, tool condition monitoring, and chatter vibration detection/suppression modules for milling processes. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. An Qinglong.

* Prior to starting my M.A., I received my B.A. in Mechanical Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology, WEIHAI](http://en.hitwh.edu.cn/) in 2017, ranked top 2 of 157 students for the four years [Click to View My Ranking Certification [PDF]](http://zhengruitao.github.io/files/ranking.pdf) and maintained ranking topmost with a GPA 93.65 for four semsters!
* <font color="#dd0000">I am looking for possible PhD research assistant opportunity starting from next year :)  !!!</font>
* Iâ€™m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science with fields like maufacturing technology, composite material structure. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Machining Experiments. Methodologically, while I am trained as a experimental engineer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
