* Hi! I am a Master student at the Manufacturing Technology Lab of the [School of Mechanical Engineering](http://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research intersts mainly lie in the areas of Bionic Structure Design, Adaptive Control, Chatter Vibration Detection/Suppression and Smart Manufacturing. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Qinglong An & Prof. Ming Chen.

* Prior to starting my M.Sc., I received my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://hitwh.edu.cn/) in 2017, ranked 2nd of 160 students for the first three years and graduated with a major GPA of 92.30 for four years!
* <font color="#dd0000">I am looking for possible Ph.D. opportunity starting from 2020 Fall :)  !!!</font>
* Iâ€™m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science with fields like maufacturing technology, composite material structure. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in Computer-Aided Simulation Work, Programing Implementation for Fast Prototyping and Testing, and Verification through Machining Experiments.
