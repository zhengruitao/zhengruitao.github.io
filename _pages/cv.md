  * *Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Ming Chen*　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　                      *09/2019 - Present*
  * Established a Virtual Machining System specific to thin-wall workpieces, including chatter stability analysis and feed rate
optimization, contributing to a 43% reduction in average cycle time and 7.4-fold improved surface finish for automotive
engine turbine machining
  * Established milling dynamics model considering regenerative chatter, and got Stability Lobe Diagram using zero-order frequency domain solution of which the relative transfer function includes the modal parameters of tool and workpiece
  * Obtained the cutter-workpiece engagement area by geometric simulation, utilized the Boolean operation to extract geometrical
parameters according to the minimum octants contacting with the cutter, and optimized the feed rate in NC code with Genetic
Algorithms to maximize the Material Removal Rate
* **Tool Condition Monitoring: Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Remaining Useful Life Prediction**　 **Shanghai,China**
  * *Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Ming Chen & Prof. Mohamed EL Mansori*　　　　　　　   *09/2018 - 09/2019*
  * Developed a hybrid framework based on LSTM and HMM capable of performing TCM during high-speed milling Ti-6Al-4V 
with diagnostic accuracy reaching up to 0.96 and prognostics MSE decreasing by 93.9%
  * Employed the global model (stacked LSTM network) to identify the current tool wear stage, inferred the wear accumulation
state sequence using the best-fitted HMM, then calculated the mean wear amount and the associated confidence interval based
on the state sequence and wear statistics
  * Proposed another integrated model combining CNN with stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTMs (SBULSTM) to
predict remaining useful life during machining 6063 aluminum alloy smartphone backplate with the three metrics (RMSE/
accuracy/ score) decreased by 77%, increased by 25% and improved by 38% compared with the Random Forest model
  * Utilized CNN for local feature extraction and dimension reduction, introduced the SBULSTM network to denoise and encode
the temporal information, built multiple fully connected layers on the top of the CNN-SBULSTM network to add nonlinearity, and employed one regression layer to generate the target RUL
