Research experience
======
* **Tool Condition Monitoring, Diagnostic, Prognostics, and Remaining Useful Life Prediction**　　**Shanghai,China**
  * *Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Qinglong An*　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　*09/2018 - Present*
  * Developed a novel method based on Long Short-Term Memory network and hidden Markov model (LSTM-HMM) hybrid framework for tool condition monitoring to diagnose tool wear status and track the flank wear during high-speed milling Ti-6Al-4V
  * Proposed an integrated model that incorporates convolutional neural network (CNN) with stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM (SBULSTM) network, named CNN-SBULSTM, to address sensor data collected by cyber-physical system for remaining useful life prediction
* **Chatter Stability Analysis and Feed Rate Optimization in the Milling Process**　　　　　　　　**Shanghai,China**
  * *Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Qinglong An*　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　*07/2017 - 09/2018*
  * Obtained the cutter-workpiece engagement area using geometric simulation and established the milling force model;the analytical regenerative chatter prediction model was presented and the time/frequency domain solutions were employed to obtain Stability Lobe Diagrams
  * With constant cutting force as the optimization target, considering the machining stability, cutting force, torque and machine power constraints, a single-objective optimization model is established. The smoothness and efficiency of machining process are improved through feed-rate optimization by segments
* **Analysis and Experimental Study on Contact Characteristics of Aviation Sealing Profile**　　　**Weihai,China**
  * *Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Jian Wu*　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　*09/2016 - 07/2017*
  * Mirco surface morphology of the sealing profile is obtained by OLYMPUS optical digital microscope. Fractal characteristics were studied based on the structural function and fractal parameters were obtained. The V-M function was employed to characterize the fractal surface, and the fractal contact model was established based on the single asperity contact model and area distribution function
  * A muliti-scale contact model of the sealing profile is developed based on the finite element model, and the contact characteristics of sealing profile in complex environment were studied
  * Macro and micro contact characteristics of an aviation seal profile are investigated  by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental testing. And A new method for calculating the real contact area is proposed by coupling the theory and finite element method, which provides a reference for the design and application of seals
* **Design of Separation Device Using Redundant Motors Basing on Two-sectiona**　　　　　　　　　**Weihai,China**
  * *Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Huiying Liu*　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　*12/2015 - 07/2016*
  * Designed innovatively a separation device to make sure the two separated parts are reliably connected, and the connection between the two parts can be rapidly released when receiving separation signal
  *  Manufactured, assembled the parts, and tested the device's separation time and reliability in vacuum and low temperature environment
