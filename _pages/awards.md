 -Developed a novel method based on [Long Short-Term Memory network](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/typical_LSTM.jpg) and [hidden Markov model](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/GMM-HMM.jpg) (LSTM-HMM) hybrid framework to track the flank wear and predict the remaining useful life of cutting tool during high-speed milling Ti-6Al-4V.

 -The cyber-physical system (CPS) is utilized to collect the internal controller signals and the external sensor signals during machining process. An integrated model that incorporates [convolutional neural network](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/CNN_structure.jpg)with stacked [bidirectional](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/Stacked-Bidirectional-and-Unidirectional-LSTM-Networks.jpg) and unidirectional LSTM (SBULSTM) network(CNN-SBULSTM) is proposed to address the collected sensor data.
