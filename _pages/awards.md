- Developed a novel method based on Long Short-Term Memory network and hidden Markov model (LSTM-HMM) hybrid framework to track the flank wear and predict the remaining useful life of cutting tool during high-speed milling Ti-6Al-4V. 

- Proposed an integrated model that incorporates convolutional neural network (CNN) with stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM (SBULSTM) network, named CNN-SBULSTM, to address sequence data produced in complex surface machining.
