* ***<font color="#660000">Virtual Machining System: Chatter Stability Analysis and Feed Rate Optimization</font>***<br>
  * <p align="center"><img src="https://zhengruitao.github.io/images/thesis_framework.jpg?raw=true" alt="Photo" style="width: 800px;"/></p>
  * Established a Virtual Machining System specific to thin-wall workpieces, including chatter stability analysis and feed rate
optimization, contributing to a **43**% reduction in average cycle time and **7.4**-fold improved surface finish for automotive engine turbine machining.<br>
  * Established milling dynamics model considering regenerative chatter, and got Stability Lobe Diagram[Stability Lobe Diagrams(SLD)](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/SLD.jpg) using the zero-order frequency domain solution of which the relative transfer function includes the modal parameters of tool and workpiece.<br>
  * Obtained the cutter-workpiece engagement area by geometric simulation, utilized the Boolean operation to extract geometrical
parameters according to the minimum octants contacting with the cutter, and optimized the feed rate in NC code with Genetic
Algorithms to maximize the Material Removal Rate.<br>

* ***<font color="#660000">Tool Condition Monitoring: Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Remaining Useful Life Prediction</font>***<br> 
  * Developed a novel method based on [Long Short-Term Memory network](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/LSTM-HMM-scheme.jpg) and [hidden Markov model](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/GMM-HMM.jpg) ([LSTM-HMM](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/LSTM-HMM-scheme.jpg)) hybrid framework to track the flank wear and predict the remaining useful life of cutting tool during high-speed milling Ti-6Al-4V.<br>

  * The cyber-physical system (CPS) is utilized to collect the internal controller signals and the external sensor signals during machining smartphone backplate. An integrated model that incorporates [convolutional neural network](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/CNN_structure.jpg) with stacked [bi-directional](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/Stacked-Bidirectional-and-Unidirectional-LSTM-Networks.jpg) and unidirectional LSTM (SBULSTM) network (CNN-SBULSTM) is proposed to track the tool wear evolution and predict its RUL.<br>

* ***<font color="#660000">Analysis and Experimental Study on Contact Characteristics of Aviation Sealing Profile</font>*** <br>
  * [Mirco surface morphology](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/surface_morphology.tif) of the sealing profile is obtained by OLYMPUS optical digital microscope. Fractal characteristics were studied based on the structural function and fractal parameters were obtained. The V-M function was employed to characterize the fractal surface, and the fractal contact model was established based on the single asperity contact model and area distribution function.<br>
  * A muliti-scale contact model of the sealing profile is developed based on the [finite element model](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/compress_in_depth.jpg), and the contact characteristics of sealing profile in complex environment were studied: [micro particles](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/micro_particles.tif) and [aging of material](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/aging_of_material.tif).<br>
  * Macro and micro contact characteristics of an aviation seal profile are investigated  by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental testing. And a new method for calculating the real contact area is proposed by coupling the theory and finite element method, which provides a reference for the design and application of seals.<br>

  * Designed innovatively a separation device to make sure the two separated parts are reliably connected, and the connection between the two parts can be rapidly released when receiving separation signal.<br>
  * Manufactured, assembled the parts, and tested the device's separation time and reliability in vacuum and low temperature environment.<br>
