* ***<font color="#660000">Tool Condition Monitoring, Diagnostic, Prognostics and Remaining Useful Life Prediction</font>***
<p align="center"><img src="https://zhengruitao.github.io/images/Framework of data-driven model.jpg?raw=true" alt="Photo" style="width: 800px;"/></p>
   - Developed a novel method based on [Long Short-Term Memory network](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/typical_LSTM.jpg) and [hidden Markov model](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/GMM-HMM.jpg) (LSTM-HMM) hybrid framework to track the flank wear and predict the remaining useful life of cutting tool during high-speed milling Ti-6Al-4V.

   - The cyber-physical system (CPS) is utilized to collect the internal controller signals and the external sensor signals during machining smartphone backplate. An integrated model that incorporates [convolutional neural network](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/CNN_structure.jpg) with stacked [bi-directional](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/Stacked-Bidirectional-and-Unidirectional-LSTM-Networks.jpg) and unidirectional LSTM (SBULSTM) network(CNN-SBULSTM) is proposed to track the tool wear evolution and predict its RUL.

* ***<font color="#660000">Chatter Stability Analysis and Feedrate Optimization in the Milling Process</font>***
<p align="center"><img src="https://zhengruitao.github.io/images/thesis_framework.jpg?raw=true" alt="Photo" style="width: 800px;"/></p>
  - Obtained the cutter-workpiece engagement area using geometric simulation and established the milling force model.<br>
  - The analytical regenerative chatter prediction model was presented and the time/frequency domain solutions were utilized to obtain [Stability Lobe Diagrams(SLD)](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/SLD.jpg).<br>
  - With constant cutting force as the optimization target, considering the machining stability, cutting force, torque and machine power constraints, a single-objective optimization model is established. The smoothness and efficiency of machining process are improved through feed-rate optimization by segments.[<u><b>More details</b></u>](http://zhengruitao.github.io/files/Optimization_Slide.pdf)<br>
* ***<font color="#660000">Analysis and Experimental Study on Contact Characteristics of Aviation Sealing Profile</font>*** <br>
  - [Mirco surface morphology](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/surface_morphology.tif) of the sealing profile is obtained by OLYMPUS optical digital microscope. Fractal characteristics were studied based on the structural function and fractal parameters were obtained. The V-M function was employed to characterize the fractal surface, and the fractal contact model was established based on the single asperity contact model and area distribution function.<br>
  - A muliti-scale contact model of the sealing profile is developed based on the [finite element model](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/compress_in_depth.jpg), and the contact characteristics of sealing profile in complex environment were studied: [micro particles](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/micro_particles.tif) and [aging of material](http://zhengruitao.github.io/images/aging_of_material.tif).<br>
  - Macro and micro contact characteristics of an aviation seal profile are investigated  by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental testing. And a new method for calculating the real contact area is proposed by coupling the theory and finite element method, which provides a reference for the design and application of seals.<br>
* ***<font color="#660000">Design of Separation Device Using Redundant Motors Basing on Two-sectional Segmented Nut</font>*** <br>
  - Designed innovatively a separation device to make sure the two separated parts are reliably connected, and the connection between the two parts can be rapidly released when receiving separation signal.<br>
  - Manufactured, assembled the parts, and tested the device's separation time and reliability in vacuum and low temperature environment.<br>
